# Nadra 

## is a website inspired by superrare.com which is made to showcase my understanding of the Web API

## I built the website to meet task requirements from my bootcamp which are:

* A functional “Save for later” page where users can earmark articles, images, recipes, etc. in a personal folder to be
able to go back and see them later.

* Each item/recipe/image, etc. must have the option to “Save for later”.

* When an item is added, an alert should tell the user how many items
are in their “Save for later” folder.

* Creating a new HTML page for the “Save for later” section, which allows
the user to see what is in their folder.

* Creating a form which allows a user to leave comments.

* Creating forms to allow a user to “like” an item/article/etc.

* Creating a form for if a person would like to contact me.

* And within the entirety of my site, I should have at least the following jQuery functionality:
■ A function which contains hiding/showing.
■ A drop-down menu.
■ Animation effects.
■ A function with chained effects.

Other features of the website which are not mentioned above may not be functional.

## How you can enjoy the site:
